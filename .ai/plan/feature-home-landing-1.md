# Introduction

![Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Progress-yellow)

This implementation plan transforms the existing basic Home.tsx component into a modern, sleek developer portfolio landing page that combines the best elements from leading 2025 portfolio designs. The enhanced landing page will feature a compelling hero section with animated typography, smooth scroll-triggered animations, a skills/expertise showcase with interactive elements, a curated featured projects gallery with hover effects, an engaging about section with professional storytelling, and clear call-to-action areas for contact and collaboration.

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use Framer Motion instead of pure CSS animations (considered but may increase bundle size)
- **ALT-002**: Implement GSAP for advanced animations (rejected due to licensing and bundle size concerns)
- **ALT-003**: Use React Spring for physics-based animations (considered but CSS animations provide better performance)
- **ALT-004**: Create separate landing page route instead of enhancing Home.tsx (rejected to maintain single-page portfolio approach)

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Existing useGitHub hook for projects and blog posts data
- **DEP-002**: Current theme system (ThemeContext, useTheme hook, CSS custom properties)
- **DEP-003**: Existing component architecture (ProjectCard, BlogPost components)
- **DEP-004**: CSS custom properties system for consistent theming
- **DEP-005**: Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations
- **DEP-006**: React 19+ features (concurrent features, transitions)
- **DEP-007**: TypeScript strict mode compliance
