## 3. Alternatives

### Alternative Testing Frameworks

- **ALT-001**: Cypress instead of Playwright - Rejected due to Playwright's superior multi-browser support and modern architecture
- **ALT-002**: Jest with Puppeteer for visual regression - Rejected due to Playwright's built-in visual testing capabilities being more robust
- **ALT-003**: pa11y instead of axe-core - Rejected due to axe-core's better Playwright integration and more comprehensive rule set
- **ALT-004**: WebPageTest API instead of Lighthouse CI - Rejected due to GitHub Actions integration complexity and cost considerations

### Alternative Implementation Approaches

- **ALT-005**: Separate testing repository - Rejected to maintain project cohesion and simplify CI/CD pipeline
- **ALT-006**: Third-party testing service (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs) - Rejected due to cost and GitHub Actions sufficient for needs
- **ALT-007**: Manual visual testing process - Rejected due to scalability issues and human error potential

- **RISK-003**: Performance tests could be inconsistent due to CI runner variability - Mitigated by multiple test runs and statistical analysis
- **RISK-004**: Accessibility tests might miss complex interaction patterns - Mitigated by combining automated and manual testing approaches

### Infrastructure Risks

- **RISK-005**: Increased CI/CD execution time could slow development workflow - Mitigated by parallelization and selective test execution
- **RISK-006**: Test artifact storage could consume significant repository space - Mitigated by retention policies and artifact cleanup automation
- **RISK-007**: GitHub Actions minute consumption increase could impact budget - Mitigated by efficient test execution and caching strategies

### Assumptions

- **ASSUMPTION-001**: GitHub Actions provides sufficient computational resources for browser automation testing
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Current site performance allows for additional testing overhead without user impact
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Team members will adopt new testing practices and maintain test quality
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Badge services (shields.io) will remain available and reliable for status indicators
