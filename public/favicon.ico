The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a suitable favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific design for the favicon, you can use an online favicon generator or design one using graphic design software. Once you have the image, save it as `favicon.ico` in the `/mrbro.dev/mrbro.dev/public/` directory.
